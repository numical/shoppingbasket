# Shopping Basket

We must be able to : 
* Add items to the shopping basket 
* Remove items from the shopping basket 
* Empty the shopping basket 
 
Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total of the shopping basket accounting for: 
* Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items 
* 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof) 
* 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards. 

For more on the thinking behind the development see [methinks](METHINKS.md).


## Installation
You will need node v6+ installed:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/numical/shoppingbasket.git
cd shoppingbasket
npm i
npm test
```

The last command will write to console the full test suite.

Note that the a `npm run debug` option is available.  For this to run you need:
* no later than node v6.3.1 (due to [this](http://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/907) bug)
* a global install of [`node-inspector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-inspector)
