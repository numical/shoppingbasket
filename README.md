# Shopping Basket

We must be able to : 
* Add items to the shopping basket 
* Remove items from the shopping basket 
* Empty the shopping basket 
 
Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total of the shopping basket accounting for: 
* Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items 
* 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof) 
* 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.
