# A Running Commentary

## GUI or no GUI
* Not asked for but would impress
* But not much time
* So, do the minimum required (demonstrable unit tests) and ensure this works
* But design-in alternative clients

## Environment
* Latest greatest javascript to show cleanest code
* Ensure runnable in latest Node
* If time for GUI, add build process with transpiling for browsers

## Sync / Async?
* Domain problem really does not require async
* So for reasonability/familiarity stick with sync

## Core Responsibilities
* Off to discovery testing...
* [Set it up](https://github.com/numical/shoppingbasket/tree/start-of-discovery-testing)
* So what dos the client (aka test, GUI etc) require?
 * an item catalogue
 * a shopping basket
* So mock these ...
